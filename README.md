# Internet Cafe DataBase

Internet Cafe Database is a project I designed in Oracle Database to manage a small internet cafe business. Interaction with this database is enabled through a GUI I developed using Flask.

It allows users to perform simple operations, such as viewing, sorting, deleting, and editing rows. It also provides options for specific tasks, such as viewing data from multiple tables or interacting with database views.
